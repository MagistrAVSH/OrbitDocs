### Using the Bot ID

Once you have your bot ID, you can use it in your local testing setup. For instructions on how to configure local testing with your bot ID, see the [Local Testing Guide](/setup/local-testing/).

### Important Notes

- Make sure to use the bot ID from the same mini app where you got your `authData`
- The "Show Peer ID's in Profile" setting is only available in Telegram Desktop and some mobile versions with experimental features enabled
