# Advertisement setup
SDK suggests for now several ways for ad integration into your apps:

### Disabling startup ads
By default, ads may be shown automatically when your game starts. To disable this behavior and have full control over when ads are displayed, configure the SDK during initialization:

=== "JavaScript"

	```JS
	await window.PortalSDK.initialize(undefined, {
	  disable_startup_ads: true,
	});
	```

### Interstitial ads
Interstitial ads are used to display video ads and should be triggered on natural breaks in your game.

=== "Unity"

	```C#
    // gameplay stops
    await PortalSDK.RequestAd();
	```

=== "Defold"

	```LUA
    -- gameplay stops
    portalsdk.request_ad(function(self, success) end)
	```


=== "JavaScript"

	```JS
    // gameplay stops
    await window.PortalSDK.requestAd()
	```
### Rewarded ads

Rewarded ads allow for a user to choose to watch a rewarded video ad in exchange for a certain benefit in the game (e.g. more coins, etc.). 
When using  🎬 `requestRewardAd()` , please make it clear to the player beforehand that they’re about to watch an ad.

=== "Unity"

	```C#
    // gameplay stops
    var success = await PortalSDK.RequestRewardAd();
    if(success) {
        // give a reward to a user
    }
	```

=== "Defold"

	```LUA
    -- gameplay stops
    portalsdk.request_reward_ad(function(self, success)
        if succcess then
            -- give a reward to a user
        end
    end)
	```


=== "JavaScript"

	```JS
    // gameplay stops
    const success = await window.PortalSDK.requestRewardAd()
    if(success) {
        // give a reward to a user
    }
	```



### Disable sound and input during ads

Make sure that audio and keyboard input are disabled during ads, so that the game doesn’t interfere with the ad:


=== "Unity"

	```C#
    // gameplay stops
    // fire your mute audio function
    var success = await PortalSDK.RequestAd();
    // fire your unmute audio function
    // fire your function to continue to game
	```

=== "Defold"

	```LUA
    -- gameplay stops
    -- fire your mute audio function
    portalsdk.request_ad(function(self, success)
        -- fire your unmute audio function
        -- fire your function to continue to game
    end)
	```


=== "JavaScript"

	```JS
    // gameplay stops
    // fire your mute audio function
    await window.PortalSDK.requestAd()
    // fire your unmute audio function
    // fire your function to continue to game

	```
