Call game-ready event   Call this method when the game is ready and visible to the user. <code>window.PortalSDK.gameReady()</code> </p> <p>Notes: Ensure you handle exceptions gracefully, especially when requesting ads.

Step: Copy the WebGL Template into Your Project       - In your Unity project directory, navigate to Assets/WebGLTemplates/.     - If it doesn\u2019t already exist, create a folder named PortalSDK.     - Copy the downloaded PortalSDK WebGL template directory into this location.    5.
